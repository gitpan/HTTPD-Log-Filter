exclude_robots
==============

Description
-----------

This script filters HTTP log files to exclude entries that correspond to know
webbots, spiders, and other undesirables. It assumes that the logs are in 
NCSA extended/combined log format (see
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html). The script requires a
URL as a command line option which should point to a text file containing a
linebreak separated list of lowercase strings to match on for bots. This is
based on the format used by ABC (http://www.abc.org.uk/exclusions/exclude.html).
